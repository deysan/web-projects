              Spain in the ocean races, the holder of the Atlantic crossing

              business. The students of his school, both beginners and
              experienced yachtsmen, were definitely lucky. He will teach
              himself at the Mikhail school, as well as the best athletes of

              Michael, tell us how your school differs from other yachting
              schools in Russia?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              Firstly, this is the largest school in Kaliningrad and one of the
              largest in Russia. The school is equipped with the most modern and
              diverse equipment. And also, not only the most experienced
              yachtsmen of Russia, but also athletes from other countries will
              teach us.

              Fans of sailing came to me, were interested in where you can
              continue training, train, find like -minded people. I could only
              advise a couple of schools, and then in Sochi or Moscow, in our
              city there was no such thing. We united with Nikolai Petrov,
              winner
              <a href="#!">Sochi Race Week 2021</a>, And they created their own
              school, which meets all the needs of beginners and professionals.

            <p class="question">Please tell us more about teachers</p>
            <p class="answer">
              I will be one of the teachers. Basically, I will conduct separate
              master classes for experienced sailors, but sometimes I will
              conduct classes in the initial groups. The leading teacher of the
              primary groups will be Nikita Gulyaev, a very experienced athlete,
              laureate of the Yaktsman of the Year 2021 Prize. Of the invited
              trainers, we have William Johnson, Ray Gilbert and Sam Lee. But,
              of course, we plan to invite other yachtsmen as often as possible.

              Oh sure! On Tuesdays, we conduct a traditional general master
              class, on Wednesday the race among amateurs, we dedicate the
              match-race on Thursday. On Friday, we give a respite, and on
              Saturday we are waiting for novice yachtsmen for a combined lesson
              - the theory plus practice on the water. On Sundays, we will
              conduct Royal Sunday Race. The race starts at four in the
              afternoon so that people can relax, chat and recharge with energy
              for the rest of the week.
